Graduated with a B.S in Electronic Engineering from UNEXPO university I've been working as a FullStack Web Developer in different capacities for a couple of years now. Currently, my focus on the technical side is on the Javascript Ecosystem with React, Typescript, and Node as my favorite tools, together with TDD (Jest/Ava) and  CI/CD Practices, Containerization, Non-Relational (MongoDB and Firestore) and relational (PostgreSQL) DBs and some DevOps tasks. 

In the past I've worked with: WordPress, Woocomerce, ROS (Robotic Operating System), and their Python implementations, Elixir and Phoenix, Kubernetes, and Webpack.
Some other tools in my arsenal are: MaterialUI, Tailwind, Angular, SCSS, and Bootstrap 

Lately, I've participated in hackathons and projects as a decent (albeit ad hoc) UI/UX designer and as a (less frequently) Product Manager

I've learned that while having a strong tech stack is vital for any project, a clear vision of what is going to be built, a healthy dedication to the UI/UX, and honest teamwork is quintessential to create a good product. 

> Most of my side projects start with a pristine Kanban Board, a new slack team, a Figma project
